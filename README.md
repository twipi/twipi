# twipi

[Package twipi][doc] contains basic abstractions around some Twilio APIs. It's
designed to easily allow Twilio to be used in a Go application by providing
high-level abstractions around the API.

If you're making a Twilio application that can handle replying to commands,
also consider using the ~~twicli package~~.
